# VidRecall Deployment Notes - December 19, 2025

## 1. Rebranding: VidRecall
- **Description**: The application has been fully rebranded from "Video RAG Search" to "VidRecall".
- **Changes**:
  - Updated UI: `search.html`, `login.html`, `signup.html`, `forgot-password.html`, `reset-password.html`, `index.html`.
  - Updated API Metadata: `rag_api.py` (FastAPI title changed to "VidRecall API").
  - Updated Backend: `email_service.py`, `simple_auth.py`, `tiktok_rag_cloud.py`.
  - Updated Shared Link Metadata: Added OpenGraph tags for better social sharing previews.
  - Updated Documentation: `README.md` and `deploy.sh`.

## 2. Email Service Fix
- **Issue**: Password reset emails were not being delivered.
- **Root Cause**: Missing `RESEND_API_KEY` and `FROM_EMAIL` in the production `.env` file.
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated remote `.env` with the correct credentials.
  - Restarted the Docker container on the production server.
  - Verified delivery via logs and user confirmation.
- **Current Sender**: `noreply@staycurrentapp.com`

## 3. Credit System
- **Verification**: Confirmed that the credit system correctly blocks searches and video additions when the balance hits zero.
- **Cost Structure**:
  - Ingest: $0.03 per video.
  - Search: $0.005 per search.
- **Initial Credit**: New users start with $2.00 free credit.

## 4. GitHub Status
- **Repository**: All changes, including the branding updates and minor bug fixes (like the syntax error in `simple_auth.py`), have been committed and pushed to the main branch.
